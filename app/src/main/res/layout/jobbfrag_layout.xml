Game review: We Are Chicago – a flawed snapshot of a troubled city

You drive around and interact with non-playing characters (mostly with your fist), but when it comes down to it, the game is all about shooting. Click on a “mission”, magically transport to that part of the map and shoot some guy – and then, as the game progresses, a bunch of guys. Ground-breaking stuff, this.
How hard is it to mess up the GTA formula? Roughneck characters, gangster talk, cool car chases, a slightly realistic city and missions that seem important, even when they’re not. None of that is present in Gangstar: New Orleans, another free-to-play cash grab made for angry teens whose parents wouldn’t buy them the latest open-world console release.
